# OpManager by RedCity Industries
# Version 4.0
# ==============================

# ==============================
# General Settings
# ==============================

# Language for plugin messages
# Available languages: en (English), de (Deutsch)
# The corresponding messages file must exist: messages_en.yml or messages_de.yml
#
# HOW TO ADD MORE LANGUAGES:
# 1. Copy an existing messages file (e.g., messages_en.yml)
# 2. Rename it to messages_<language_code>.yml (e.g., messages_fr.yml for French)
# 3. Translate all messages inside the file
# 4. Set the language here to your new language code (e.g., language: fr)
# 5. Reload the plugin with /reload or restart the server
language: de

# Enable verbose logging (detailed debug information in console)
# true = Show detailed logs (useful for debugging)
# false = Show only essential logs (recommended for production)
verbose_logging: false

# ==============================
# IMPORTANT WARNING - ITEM DUPLICATION
# ==============================
#
# If you die during an active OP session (after using /opon),
# your items will drop at your death location.
# When you use /opoff afterwards, your saved items will be restored.
# This means you can pick up the dropped items AND have your saved items,
# resulting in ITEM DUPLICATION!
#
# To prevent duplication:
# - Use /opoff FIRST (restores your saved items)
# - Then decide if you want to pick up the dropped items
# - Or simply ignore the dropped items
#
# ADDITIONAL RISK:
# If you pick up another player's items during your OP session and then die,
# those items will drop and might be lost!
# Be extra careful when helping other players during OP sessions!

# ==============================
# Vanish Plugin Settings
# ==============================

# Automatically disable vanish when running /opoff command.
# true = Vanish will be disabled automatically
# false = Vanish remains active (recommended if unsure)
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING - TOGGLE COMMANDS:
# If your vanish plugin uses a TOGGLE command (turns vanish on/off with the same command),
# setting this to TRUE can cause unwanted behavior:
#
# Example Problem:
# 1. You are NOT in vanish mode
# 2. You run /opoff
# 3. The plugin executes the vanish command
# 4. Result: Vanish gets ACTIVATED instead of deactivated!
#
# SOLUTION:
# - Set this to FALSE if your plugin uses toggle commands
# - Only set it to TRUE if your vanish plugin has a dedicated "turn OFF" command
#
# Examples of SAFE commands (dedicated OFF commands):
#   - "vanish off {player}" (if plugin supports "off" parameter)
#   - "vanish disable {player}" (if plugin supports "disable" parameter)
#   - "sv off {player}" (SuperVanish with explicit OFF)
#
# Examples of UNSAFE commands (toggle commands):
#   - "vanish {player}" (toggles vanish on/off - RISKY!)
#   - "vanishium:vium {player}" (VanishIUM toggle - RISKY!)
#   - "v {player}" (most plugins - RISKY!)
#
# If you're unsure, leave this set to FALSE!
auto_disable_vanish: false

# Command to disable vanish (without leading slash)
# Use {player} as placeholder for the player name
# This is only used if auto_disable_vanish is set to true!
#
# Examples:
#   - "vanishium:vium {player}" (VanishIUM toggle)
#   - "vanish off {player}" (if your plugin supports "off")
#   - "sv off {player}" (SuperVanish)
vanish_disable_command: "vanishium:vium {player}"

# ==============================
# Inventory and Gamemode Settings
# ==============================

# Should the player's inventory be saved when they run /opon?
# If false, only position and gamemode are saved.
# true = Save inventory, armor, offhand, XP, health, hunger, effects
# false = Save only position and gamemode
inventory_save: true

# ==============================
# OP Whitelist Settings
# ==============================

# Enable or disable the whitelist for /opon command.
# true = Only players listed below can use /opon and related commands
# false = ANY player can use /opon and gain OP permissions!
#
# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:
# If whitelist_enabled is set to false, ANY player can use:
# - /opon (grant themselves OP)
# - /opoff (remove OP and restore data)
# - /opreturnback (teleport to saved position)
# - /opRestoreInventory (restore saved inventory)
#
# This essentially gives everyone on your server the ability to grant themselves OP!
#
# SECURITY RECOMMENDATION:
# Keep this set to TRUE unless you trust ALL players on your server!
whitelist_enabled: true

# List of player names allowed to gain OP via /opon.
# Add exact Minecraft usernames (case-sensitive).
#
# HOW TO ADD PLAYERS TO THE WHITELIST:
# 1. Make sure whitelist_enabled is set to true (see above)
# 2. Add player names below with a dash (-) and space before each name
# 3. Player names are case-sensitive (must match exactly!)
# 4. Save the file and reload with /reload or restart the server
#
# Example with multiple players:
# whitelist:
#   - Gamer100309
#   - AnotherAdmin
#   - TrustedModerator
#   - BuilderName
whitelist:
  - Placeholder👑User

# ==============================
# Data Storage Strategy
# ==============================

# Choose how player data (inventory, XP, position, etc.) is stored:
#
# MEMORY_ONLY:
#   - Data is saved only in RAM (fastest performance)
#   - ⚠️ WARNING: Data will be LOST on server crash, restart, or reload!
#   - ⚠️ WARNING: Data will be LOST if player disconnects!
#   - Use only for testing or if you accept the risk of data loss
#
# DISK_ONLY:
#   - Data is saved only to disk (safe from crashes/restarts)
#   - Slightly slower than MEMORY_ONLY, but still fast
#   - Files are automatically deleted after /opoff
#   - Recommended for servers with frequent restarts
#
# DISK_AND_MEMORY:
#   - Data is saved in both RAM and on disk (best of both worlds)
#   - Fast access from RAM with disk backup for safety
#   - Disk files are automatically deleted after /opoff
#   - Recommended for most servers (balanced performance + safety)
#
# NOTE: Disk files in 'plugins/OpManager/playerdata/' are temporary!
#       They are automatically deleted when you run /opoff.
#       Only active OP sessions are stored on disk.
